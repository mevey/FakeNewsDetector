    <mainText>During a campaign stop in Philadelphia, Vice President Joe Biden slammed Donald Trump&#8217;s debate performance Monday night &#8211;- specifically taking umbrage with the GOP nominee's comments on the housing crisis. "This is a guy who said -- and wants to be president -- that it was good business for him to see the housing market fail. What in the hell is he talking about?" Biden said during a rally at Drexel University. "Every president I have served with, including Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American, about what we&#8217;re supposed to do, about what basic fundamental rights are." Biden asked the crowd if they could imagine Ronald Reagan, "saying it's good business to take advantage of people&#8217;s misery, rooting for that misery?" "He does not have the basic fundamental sensibilities and values that almost every American politician left, right and center I know have," Biden said. "They disagree on how to make things better for you, but they don&#8217;t take pleasure from 'You&#8217;re fired.' They don&#8217;t take pleasure knowing that they will benefit." During the first presidential debate, Hillary Clinton said Trump was rooting for a collapse in the housing market, to which the real-estate mogul responded, "That's called business, by the way." "When you&#8217;re sitting atop Trump Tower, in a semi-golden palace, not a joke, what do you care about the people that I grew up with?" Biden said of Trump. The vice president also criticized Trump's suggestion that not paying taxes "makes me smart." "He acknowledged that he didn&#8217;t pay taxes because, he said, he&#8217;s smart. Makes him smart," Biden said. "Tell that to the janitor in here who&#8217;s paying taxes. Tell that to your mothers and fathers who are breaking their neck to send you here who are paying their taxes. No I really mean it. It angers me.&#8221; He added that the views Trump expressed in the debate demonstrate his outlook on the country. "If this choice isn&#8217;t clear, I don&#8217;t know &#8211;- my lord," Biden said about the debate. "What bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people."</mainText>
