    <mainText>Hillary is without a doubt, the worst and most despicable liar to ever run for the office of President Of The United States&#8230; Hillary is a sociopathic liar: A sociopath is typically defined as someone who lies incessantly to get their way and does so with little concern for others. A sociopath is often goal-oriented (i.e., lying is focused&#8212;it is done to get one&#8217;s way). Sociopaths have little regard or respect for the rights and feelings of others.
