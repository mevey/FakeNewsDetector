    <mainText>Donald Trump on Thursday offered some advice to Lester Holt, who will moderate Monday&#8217;s presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton: Don&#8217;t be Candy Crowley. The Republican presidential nominee suggested that the &#8220;NBC Nightly News&#8221; anchor be a moderator, not a fact-checker, a recommendation that comes after NBC&#8217;s Matt Lauer faced intense criticism earlier this month after allowing Trump&#8217;s assertion that he didn&#8217;t support the Iraq War go unchecked. Story Continued Below &#8220;Well, I think he has to be a moderator,&#8221; Trump told &#8220;Fox and Friends&#8221; of Holt during a phone interview Thursday morning. &#8220;I mean, you&#8217;re debating somebody and if she makes a mistake or I make a mistake, I&#8217;ll, you know, we&#8217;ll take each other on. But I certainly don&#8217;t think you want Candy Crowley again.&#8221; Crowley, who moderated a 2012 debate at Hofstra University, where Trump and Clinton will square off Monday, attempted to fact check then-GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who said it took President Barack Obama 14 days to call the attack in Benghazi, Libya, an &#8220;act of terror.&#8221; &#8220;And she turned out to be wrong. I really don&#8217;t think you want that,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;That was a very pivotal moment in that debate. And it really threw the debate off and it was unfair. So I don&#8217;t think you want that. No, I think you have to have somebody that&#8217;s just &#8212; let them argue it out.&#8221; PolitiFact later rated Romney&#8217;s criticism &#8220;half true,&#8221; noting that Obama did say &#8220;act of terror&#8221; right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak &#8220;consistently in the days that followed."</mainText>
