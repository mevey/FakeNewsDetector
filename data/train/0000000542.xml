    <mainText>While most assuredly Obama, Hillary and other Democrat politicians struggle to find a &#8220;motive&#8221; for a man to stab eight people in a Minnesota shopping mall on Saturday evening, the Associated Press (AP) is reporting that ISIS-linked media is claiming that the evil animal doing the stabbing was a &#8220;soldier of the Islamic State.&#8221; So, they&#8217;re saying that it wasn&#8217;t &#8220;workplace violence?&#8221; BREAKING: IS-linked media claims Minnesota mall stabber was 'soldier of the Islamic State.' &#8212; The Associated Press (@AP) September 18, 2016  In other words, &#8220;RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.&#8221; Say it Hillary! Say it Obama! Say it! Moreover, the knife attacker referenced &#8220;Allah&#8221; during the attack and asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before assaulting, via a report from KSTP, the local ABC affiliate in the Twin Cities. BREAKING: St. Cloud mall stabbing attack suspect referenced Allah during attack, asked at least 1 victim if they were Muslim before assault &#8212; Steve Tellier KSTP (@stellierkstp) September 18, 2016  Thankfully, a good guy with a gun took the terrorist out before more violence could take place. KSTP reporter Steve Tellier also reports that all eight victims are expected to survive. It was off-duty police officer who fired shots that killed St. Cloud mall stabbing attack suspect inside mall &amp; ended attack. &#8212; Steve Tellier KSTP (@stellierkstp) September 18, 2016   Email Subscribe</mainText>
