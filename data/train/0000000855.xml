    <mainText>In another disgusting display of Donald&#8217;s Trump selfish priorities, the Republican presidential nominee rushed to defend himself and the&#160;ignorant comments he made on&#160;the New York City bombings&#160;immediately after the attack, before having any official information on the matter whatsoever. Facing&#160;major backlash from the media for his audacity, Donald Trump decided to double-down on his irresponsible comments instead of admitting he had spoken out of turn. &#8220;The Donald&#8221;&#160;claimed that not only was&#160;he was right to rush to call the attack a &#8220;bomb,&#8221; he also deserved credit from the media for having &#8220;predicted it&#8221; before they confirmed it,&#160;when in fact&#160;the media was busy doing their due diligence to present the facts and not&#160;report the event&#160;so carelessly. Trump&#160;went on Fox News to say, &#8220;What I said was exactly correct. I should be a newscaster because I called it before the news.&#160;But what I said was exactly correct and everybody says, &#8220;While he was right, he called it too soon.&#8221; Donald Trump&#8217;s priorities are clearer now more than ever. Time after time, whenever tragedy strikes, Trump finds a way to make it about himself &#8211; no condolences for the 29 injured,&#160;and his self-aggrandizing knows no bounds, even when there are American lives at stake, and sensitive material that needs to be treated with careful consideration. As of this morning, a suspect is in custody. Is this the way we should expect Donald Trump to behave if elected&#160;Commander-In Chief? Not on our watch. .@realDonaldTrump slams &#8220;dishonest&#8221; CNN for editing out Clinton reference to NYC explosion as &#8216;bombing&#8217; pic.twitter.com/EG2Yy63B4y &#8212; FOX &amp; Friends (@foxandfriends) September 19, 2016 </mainText>
