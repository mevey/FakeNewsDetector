    <mainText>It&#8217;s true that conservatives have a tendency to take the opinions of reality stars with many grains of salt, especially because they have a tendency to be mindlessly liberal and ill-informed. Brody Jenner, however, has said something worth sharing. Brody is the son of Caitlyn (then Bruce) Jenner and actress Linda Thompson, and stars in &#8220;The Hills,&#8221; a show that I&#8217;ve never seen and for which I can give you no description.   Twitter exploded after Brody Jenner posted a comment on Instagram claiming that not everything is about race. Of course, adding &#8220;All Lives Matter&#8221; was pretty much the end of it. The perpetually-offended crowd took to their keyboards to let him know that he&#8217;s a terrible person because he&#8217;s white and a man, and straight and &#8220;cis-gender.&#8221; Below is the offending post: &#8220;I normally don&#8217;t speak about this type of stuff, but this is just ridiculous. I can&#8217;t even watch the news anymore without getting pissed off. This has nothing to do with race. White, black, brown, any color&#8230;if you have an officer of the law telling you to exit your vehicle (or do anything for that matter)&#8230;you comply. And not only do you comply, but you do so willingly and follow directions completely. And why in the world would you exit that vehicle with a weapon in hand (allegedly?!) That makes no sense! And if, let&#8217;s just say, you DON&#8217;T have a gun, why would you not put your hands up in the air and state &#8220;I do not have a gun&#8221; so that the officers can clearly see that you don&#8217;t??&#8221; After receiving backlash, he posted another photo on Instagram, salting the wounds of the whining babies on the left.  Predictably, liberals lost their ever-loving minds over this, but it&#8217;s honestly just par for the course with these people. They are always looking for something by which they can be offended. </mainText>
