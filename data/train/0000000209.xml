    <mainText>Donald Trump&#226;&#128;&#153;s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was backed into a proverbial corner on MSNBC&#226;&#128;&#153;s Morning Joe trying to defend Trump&#226;&#128;&#153;s latest comments. Bloomberg Politics host Mark Halperin first called her out on the fact that Trump called the debate&#226;&#128;&#153;s moderator a Democrat&#194;&#160;when that wasn&#226;&#128;&#153;t even true. And, Conway&#226;&#128;&#153;s response? Trump didn&#226;&#128;&#153;t lie, he just didn&#226;&#128;&#153;t know. Here&#226;&#128;&#153;s Halperin: &#226;&#128;&#156;He said Lester Holt (the debate moderator) was a Democrat. Lester Holt is a Republican. How could he say such a thing that just black-and-white factually incorrect?&#226;&#128;&#157; &#226;&#128;&#156;I don&#226;&#128;&#153;t know that he knew what Lester Holt&#226;&#128;&#153;s voter registration is,&#226;&#128;&#157; Conway said. Conway tried to pivot, saying &#226;&#128;&#156;first of all, if you tell me the media are not overly populated with Democrats, that&#226;&#128;&#153;s false,&#226;&#128;&#157; but Holt just wasn&#226;&#128;&#153;t buying it. &#226;&#128;&#156;I&#226;&#128;&#153;m asking about a very specific thing,&#226;&#128;&#157; Halperin said. &#226;&#128;&#156;He made a factual claim about the moderator who deserves the right to be treated fairly and it was just wrong. And it&#226;&#128;&#153;s a metaphor for his frequently in public stating things with no basis, that are wrong.&#226;&#128;&#157; After much back and forth, Halperin just became exasperated trying to get an answer out of her. &#226;&#128;&#156;You&#226;&#128;&#153;re not answering what I asked you,&#226;&#128;&#157; Halperin said. &#226;&#128;&#156;I&#226;&#128;&#153;m asking you how someone running for president can assert on the eve of the debate that the moderator is a Democrat, which is factually incorrect? How can he do that?&#226;&#128;&#157; .@KellyannePolls: Trump &#226;&#128;&#152;didn&#226;&#128;&#153;t lie&#226;&#128;&#153; about Lester Holt, &#226;&#128;&#152;a lie would mean that he knew the man&#226;&#128;&#153;s party registration&#226;&#128;&#153; https://t.co/dZWTCwpoim &#226;&#128;&#148; Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) September 26, 2016 </mainText>
