    <mainText>&#8220;[Trump is] someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers.&#8221;&#8212; Hillary Clinton &#8220;I never said that.&#8221; &#8212; Donald Trump Trump did make such a claim. In a 2004 interview with NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Dateline,&#8221; Trump said pregnancy is &#8220;a wonderful thing for the woman, it&#8217;s a wonderful thing for the husband, it's certainly an inconvenience for a business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business.&#8221;</mainText>
