    <mainText>President Barack Obama joked Thursday that actor Morgan Freeman couldn&#8217;t make it to a White House ceremony for National Medals of the Arts and Humanities recipients because he &#8220;undoubtedly is off playing a black president again.&#8221; &#8220;He never lets me have my moment,&#8221; the president added once the laughter subsided. Story Continued Below Obama also quipped that Thursday&#8217;s medal recipients included NPR host Terry Gross &#8220;and a whole bunch of people who Terry Gross has interviewed.&#8221; Legendary comedy writer and director Mel Brooks got top billing at the ceremony, which also honored chef Jose Andres, jazz musician Wynton Marsalis and author Sandra Cisneros, among others. &#8220;As Mel Brooks once said to his writers on 'Blazing Saddles,' which is a great film, &#8216;Write anything you want because we&#8217;ll never be heard from again. We will all be arrested for this movie,&#8217;&#8221; the president said in his introductory remarks. &#8220;Now to be fair, Mel also said, a little more eloquently, that every human being has hundreds of separate people living inside his skin and the talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living within him,&#8221; Obama continued. &#8220;And that I think, is [what] the arts and humanities do: They lift up our identities and make us see ourselves in each other.&#8221;</mainText>
