    <mainText>During tonight&#8217;s debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he received a &#8220;small loan&#8221; from his father to begin his business career. That &#8220;small loan&#8221; was for over a million dollars, and his father continued to give him financial backing throughout the early years of his career. His &#8220;success&#8221; is proof of the adage that you &#8220;need money to make money,&#8221; as he borrowed $14 million from his father and received a blind trust fund which gave him another million. Trump complained to&#160;POLITICO that&#160;&#8220;It has not been easy for me. It has not been easy for me. I started off in Brooklyn. My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars,&#8221; Trump remarked. &#8220;I came into Manhattan, and I had to pay him back, and I had to pay him back with interest. But I came into Manhattan and I started buying properties, and I did great.&#8221; Yes, poor Trump spent his early years in expensive boarding schools and was given start-up money for his &#8220;business&#8221; career, the success of which has been questionable at best, given his multiple bankruptcies. It&#8217;s hard to imagine anyone more representative of the selfish excesses of wealthy America or be more disconnected from the struggles of everyday Americans. It&#8217;s mind-boggling to understand how anyone can pretend this man cares or even understands the problems facing the American middle class. &#160;</mainText>
