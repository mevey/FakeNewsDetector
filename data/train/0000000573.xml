    <mainText>From the Daily Caller News Foundation: The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims. Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he&#160;planted bombs&#160;in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to &#8220;selective enforcement&#8221; based on Islam,&#160;reports&#160;The Daily Mail. Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with &#8220;baseless&#8221; tickets, and that locals said: &#8220;Muslims don&#8217;t belong here.&#8221; Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad. He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.
