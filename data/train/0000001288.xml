    <mainText>Hillary Clinton drew applause Monday night for taking a shot at Donald Trump over having prepared for the first presidential debate &#8211; and similarly preparing &#8220;to be president.&#8221; Trump talked about his visits to &#8220;the inner cities&#8221; during a debate segment about race and policing but couldn&#8217;t resist also taking a shot at Clinton, who spent multiple days preparing for the debate in recent weeks. Story Continued Below &#8220;I just left Detroit, I just left Philadelphia. You've seen me, I've been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's okay. I will tell you, I've been all over,&#8221; Trump said. &#8220;I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing,&#8221; Clinton said in reply.</mainText>
