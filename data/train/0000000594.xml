    <mainText>Please disable your Ad Blocker in order to interact with the site. A key skill for ANY public speaker is the ability to handle a hostile audience. Hillary &#8211; sadly &#8211; does not appear to have learned this skill. Watch as she waits for the audience to come to her rescue:  She&#8217;s not very good at this at all. She missed a really good chance at a humanizing laugh line. Imagine the crowd response if she&#8217;d told the heckler to direct his comment to Bill? Too late. The moment is gone. Share if you think Hillary&#8217;s unfit to be President in EVERY possible way. </mainText>
