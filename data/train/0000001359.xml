    <mainText>Former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu endorsed Donald Trump on Tuesday, hours after the Republican presidential nominee faced off against Hillary Clinton at their first presidential debate. In a statement released by Trump&#8217;s campaign, Sununu hailed the real estate mogul as the only candidate &#8220;who can bring bold change to Washington&#8221; and called for Americans to coalesce around his campaign. Story Continued Below &#8220;Donald Trump is the only candidate in this race who can bring bold change to Washington D.C.,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I support the Trump-Pence ticket for their pro-growth agenda and commitment to protecting American interests. Republicans, Independents and smart Democrats need to come together to elect Donald Trump and Mike Pence.&#8221;</mainText>
