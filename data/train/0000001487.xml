    <mainText>Dang&#8230; and I thought our Social Justice Zealots were insane (I mean, they are. But this is NUTS). In this video, a Muslim woman from Perth, Australia, is having an unholy fit when she sees someone wearing a Pauline Hanson shirt. If you don&#8217;t know, Pauline Hanson is a right-wing senator in Australia who has proposed a ban on Muslim immigration in her country. Oh, and this confrontation took place on a university campus, which doesn&#8217;t surprise me &#8211; Well, she&#8217;s got the special snowflake screeching down. I&#8217;ll give her that much. According to this, the man with the shirt said he was a former student coming to meet with someone on campus and he has every right to be there, even though the Muslim woman demanded he leave. Just because he was wearing a shirt. Listen lady &#8211; maybe that&#8217;s how they do things in Islamic countries where you aren&#8217;t even allowed to THINK anything that goes against Muslim beliefs, but in first-world civilizations, we welcome ALL KINDS of opinions. Well, that&#8217;s the theory, at least. Maybe not much longer if the Cult of Social Justice gets their way.</mainText>
