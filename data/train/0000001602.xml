    <mainText>A Louisiana police officer has been fired and arrested after being caught on camera repeatedly beating a burglary suspect while he was handcuffed and lying facedown. Footage of Officer Robert Wallow was found in which he punched&#160;21-year-old Carlos&#160;Gustavo in the face after successfully arresting him. Wallow then handcuffed Pineda and then kick him three more times in the head and the side. Gustavo&#8217;s arrest occurred on April 22nd, but since Pineda or his attorney did not report any use of excessive force, the incident was not discovered by authorities until Wallow was a subject of an internal inquiry in relation to another case. &#8220;It all had been documented,&#8221; said Police Chief Arthur Lawson. &#8220;It just did not move as quickly as it should have.&#8221; Wallow was placed on administrative leave and then fired the next day. The department quickly opened a criminal investigations into Wallow&#8217;s cruel tactics. He has been charged with battery and malfeasance in office. &#8220;This is not one of the brightest days of the Gretna Police Department,&#8221; said Lawson.
