Here is the full cover up as it has already begun. Hillary Clinton calling the explosions in Chelsea, New York a bombing and then directly after making that statements a press correspondent asked her how she felt about Donald Trump taking the stage and calling it a bombing. To which of course she made the statement &#8220;it&#8217;s wiser to wait&#8221; &#8211; watch and be disgusted with the complicit media and the democrat nominee for president of the United States not even remember what they said moments before. </mainText>
