    <mainText>Donald Trump is the antithesis of the United States, according to U2 frontman Bono, who called the Republican presidential nominee &#8220;potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America.&#8221; &#8220;Look, America is like the best idea the world ever came up with,&#8221; Bono, whose real name is Paul David Hewson, told &#8220;CBS This Morning&#8221; in an interview broadcast Tuesday. &#8220;But Donald Trump is potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America. Potentially.&#8221; Story Continued Below Bono pointed to nations like Ireland and Great Britain as great countries but suggested that America is different because it&#8217;s an idea, one that Trump is &#8220;trying to hijack.&#8221; &#8220;That idea is bound up in justice and equality for all &#8212; equality and justice for all, you know,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;I think he&#8217;s hijacked the party. I think he&#8217;s trying to hijack the idea of America. And I think it&#8217;s bigger than all of us. I think it&#8217;s &#8212; it&#8217;s &#8212; this is really dangerous.&#8221;</mainText>
