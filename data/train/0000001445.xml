    <mainText>Really? Hillary Clinton is now vowing to take on racism, and she&#8217;s starting with our Police Officers? This woman is an idiot. Words nearly fail me on this one&#8230;because it is just so ridiculous! The woman, is making all the wrong choices, and desperately trying to win votes. The so-called &#8216;racism&#8217; issue does not begin with Police Officers or white people&#8230; The woman has gone certifiably &#8230; MAD. &#8220;We gotta tackle the systemic racism, this horrible shooting again, how many times do we have to see this in our country?&#8221; she said in an appearance on the Steve Harvey show. Clinton was specifically referring to the police shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, saying he had his &#8220;hands in the air&#8221; when he was killed. &#8220;This is unbearable and it needs to be intolerable,&#8221; she said. Clinton told Harvey that if the African-American community came out and voted for her, she would work to stop racial shootings by police officers. &#8220;Maybe I can by speaking directly to white people say, &#8216;Look this is not who we are,&#8217;&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to do everything possible to improve policing, to go right at implicit bias. Actually Hillary&#8230;what we need to is to STOP putting divisive, selfish, wicked people into the White House as President&#8230;who creates problems so they can look like a hero when they say stupid crap like this. She wants this chaos, Obama wants this chaos. It&#8217;s breeding grounds for &#8216;stupid&#8217; and they want the American people&#8230; stupid, so they can continue running the place however they please.</mainText>
