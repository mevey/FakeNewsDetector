    <mainText>Former President George H.W. Bush plans to vote for Hillary Clinton in the upcoming election, according to a report by Politico. The Republican 41st president and member of a conservative political dynasty that spans several generations will vote against his party, says the scion of another family at the center of American politics. Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, posted to Facebook, "The President told me he&#8217;s voting for Hillary!!&#8221; Townsend told Politico she met with Bush, 92, in Maine on Monday, where he told her about his preference in this year&#8217;s ballot. &#8220;That&#8217;s what he said,&#8221; she told Politico. &#8220;The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days,&#8221; a spokesman for Bush told ABC News. &#8220;He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.&#8221; </mainText>
