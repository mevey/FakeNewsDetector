    <mainText>I’m probably going to a very not good place for laughing at this, but I can’t help that it’s so dang funny!  There has been a theory floating around that Hillary Clinton is just a robot disguised as a human. While that may seem out-of-this-world ridiculous, remember that she admitted to “short-circuiting.” I’m fairly confident that this is not a term that people often use to describe their forgetting something of importance. And then, adding to the pile of evidence to validate this theory is this little gem picked up from the Twitterverse:  Some guy right in Hillary’s face: HILLARY FOR PRISON Hillary: LET’S MAKE IT HAPPEN I almost feel sorry for her https://t.co/CKfdSuASHB — Jenna Abrams (@Jenn_Abrams) September 18, 2016   When some man yells “Hillary For Prison!” right in her face, Hillary responds with a strangely enthusiastic “Let’s make it happen!” Now I’ve never been to prison so I’m not entirely confident about this, but it would seem that it’s not a place that you would be that excited to go to. If that doesn’t have you rolling on the floor with laughter, this screengrab might:  Awesome. Just… awesome.  </mainText>
